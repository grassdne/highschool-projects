            was aware of the series of cyberattacks going on against United States Health Centers. It was on their
            radar.
            But they were left helpless on October 28, 2020 when everyone across the medical center started having
            trouble
            accessing the computer systems. By then, thousands of computers and servers were already infected.

          <h3 id="the-medical-center" class="section-head">The Medical Center</h3>
          <p class="parag" style="margin-top: 20px;">
            The UVM Medical Center claims to be a referral center for more than 1 million people in Vermont and northern
            New York. They store all clinical, anatomical, and administrative information in a database management
            system
            for the ability to retrieve that data at any time. They have established a network computing architecture
            which enables the flow of this information to and from customers, students and staff.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            This is a huge medical center with modern systems connecting all their thousands of computers including
            desktops, laptops, and even phones. This is a very productive setup and allows the medical center to have
            the
            capabilities to support such a large range of people.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            They will soon find the flipside of their interconnected system to hit hard.

          <p class="parag">
            A New York Times article from late September of 2020 states that “it has been the fear haunting federal
            officials for a year now: in the days leading up to the election, or in its aftermath, ransomware groups
            will
            try to freeze voter registration data, election poll books or the computer systems of the secretaries of the
            state who certify election results.”
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            CNN, in the same week of when the ransomware on the UVM Med Center hit,
            published an article on a recent ransomware attack on Hall County in Georgia. It affected critical systems
            and
            the voter signature database, as well as a voting precinct map hosted on the county's website, according to
            Katie Crumley, a Hall County spokesperson.

            Malware was becoming all too common.
            The costs could be devastating.
            The IT department at the UVM Medical Center was aware of all this.
            They had powerful security systems to prevent cyberattacks.
            The medical center even made plans to prepare for multiple days of downtime.
            Why were they unable to prevent a massive system-wide cyberattack?
          </p>

          <h3 class="section-head">October 28, 2020</h3>

          <p class="parag">
            With the incoming reports the IT department of the medical center suspected that their systems had been
            infected with malware. They took no chances; taking down internet access, employee email, and the electronic
            health record system.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            This may have saved them from an irrecoverable predicament, but the fast
            action was not nearly as fast as the near-instantaneous spreading of malware across their computer systems.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            A scan of all
            files was performed, and a single text file containing a brief worrying message was discovered. It included
            contact information for the attackers and demanded that they contact them if they wanted to restore their
            systems.
          </p>

          </p>
          <div class="image-div">

          <p class="parag">
            But they never contacted the attackers as Gentile, Senior Vice President of Network Information Technology
            at
            the medical center explains to WCAX, “Because we already had backups, we were going to have to rebuild that
            anyways, just to ensure we got rid of the malware. So it wasn’t going to save us any time and, in fact, they
            encrypted some of the pieces you need to use with the key to de-encrypt, those were encrypted, so even if we
            had gotten the key, we couldn’t have used it.”
          </p>

          <p class="parag">
            In addition to their data being encrypted, malware was deposited across their devices, and if they wanted to
            ensure riddance of the malware everything would have to be wiped and rebuilt. And so even if they could
            decrypt their data it would leave malware, and they would still want to go through the process of a
            factory reset to get rid of it.
          </p>

          <p class="parag">
            Not only were worries of ransomware undermining the U.S. election rising, but a series of these cyberattacks
            had recently been occurring on American Health Systems across the country. According to a survey done by UK
            based cybersecurity company Sophos, ⅓ of healthcare organizations were hit by ransomware in 2020, and 65% of
            those said the cybercriminals succeeded in encrypting their data.
          <p class="parag">
            The United States Government has now launched an official resource at
            <a href="https://StopRansomware.gov" target="_blank">StopRansomware.gov</a>
            to help people and organizations prevent, defend, and report ransomware.

            In 2020, a patient in Germany died
            while being re-routed to another healthcare facility during a ransomware attack.

            Ransomware is a kind of malware (malicious software) that can lock access to your computer files, systems,
            or networks.
            And often encrypts the data on your computer, external drives, and networked computers.
            According to the FBI, “You can unknowingly download ransomware onto a computer by opening an email
            attachment,
            clicking an ad, following a link, or even visiting a website that's embedded with malware.”
            Ransomware demands a ransom to unfreeze your computer or decrypt your files.
          </p>
          <h3 class="section-head">Rise of Malware</h3>
          <p class="parag">
            Cyberattacks, malware, and ransomware are on a rise throughout the US and the world.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            Vulnerabilities in programs simply occur too easily.
            Try typing something into the following input field.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            <input type="text" id="input-example">
          <div id="output-example"></div>
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            As you can see, all this does is display back it's input;
            a very common thing in web pages.
            But this is done by inserting the input into the
            HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, of the web page. Try pasting in the following. <br>
            <code>This is &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;</code>
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            Notice the bold text in the result. Not just text is inserted,
            but an actual markup language.
            To allow raw text to be inserted, websites must first replace these special
            characters like `&lt;` and `&gt;` with their respective HTML escape sequences `&amp;lt;`
            and `&amp;gt;`.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            In the modern web there is Javascript, a fully fledged programming language,
            which is used to make websites dynamic and capable.
            Javascript can be run in the browser by putting it between special "script" tags like so:<br>
            <code>&lt;script&gt;alert()&lt;/script&gt;</code>
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            Putting this into the text box won't do anything because the latest version
            of HTML specifically ignores &lt;script&gt; tags inserted in this way, but
            it is not effective to prevent Javascript injections because there are numerous other ways
            to insert Javascript into HTML. <br>
            <code>&lt;img src="x" onerror="alert('oops')"&gt;</code>
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            On this page there is no security concern because there is no backend server
            behind this page.
            But, websites commonly store input data and display it to other users, in which
            case it would be executed for all of those users. Think forums and media.
            Another very common situation is the input is encoded as URL parameters so that the
            server can read it.
            This allows the creation of a malicious link to a legitimate website.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            Finally, the injection can have access to any cookies, session tokens, 
            or other sensitive site-specific information according to Mozilla.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            All it takes to prevent this vulnerability is to have all angle brackets be replaced
            by their escaped counterparts, but you only need forget once. And then there's all the
            other vulnerabilities to worry about.
          </p>
          <h3 class="section-head">TrickBot and Botnets</h3>
          <p class="parag">
            The perpetrators of the ransomware attack on the UVM Medical Center were found to be a powerful,
            Russian-speaking cybercriminal group known to be behind a malware tool called TrickBot. TrickBot is a vast
            network of infected computers controlled by constantly changing internet servers to perform their own
            cyberattacks and expand the untraceable network. This is known as a botnet.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            According to Microsoft, 
            “The botnet's operators have all the IT support of legitimate enterprises — 
            continuity planning, backups, automated deployment, and a dedicated workforce — 
            that allow them to quickly react to disruptive measures.” 
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            According to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, 
            “TrickBot now provides its operators a full suite of tools to conduct a myriad of 
            illegal cyber activities. These activities include credential harvesting, mail exfiltration,
            cryptomining, point-of-sale data exfiltration, and the deployment of ransomware, such as Ryuk
            and Conti.”
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            Last Fall, Microsoft and the U.S. Cyber Command took separate, significant action to take down TrickBot
            servers as it created a high risk of undermining the 2020 US Election.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            Microsoft analyzed infected computers and was able to determine exact IP addresses of servers that the
            infected computers were communicating with. Microsoft won court approval to disable these IP addresses by
            claiming TrickBot to be malicious use of Microsoft Windows software code.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            The U.S. Military Cyber Command was also taking action by hacking into TrickBot’s control centers.
          </p>
          <h3 class="section-head">The Recovery</h3>
          <p class="parag">
            It was fortunate that the medical center had all essential data backed up before the ransomware as they
            would
            never get back anything that was encrypted. Only the attackers would have had the key to decrypt it, and
            breaking modern encryption is essentially impossible and will be for the foreseen amount of time. For
            example,
            a 256-bit encryption has 2<sup>256</sup> different possibilities, or about

          <p class="parag">
            The day of the cyberattack <span id="cling-leffler">Stephen Leffler</span>, the president of the medical
            center, said to VTDigger, “We’re
            prepared if
            this lasts one more day or a week.” But what followed was a painstaking process of several weeks of cleaning
            and rebuilding 1,300 servers and 5,000 laptop and desktop computers. The Vermont National Guard was called
            in
            to aid in this. During this period the UVM Health Network stated that all media inquiries regarding the
            investigation should be directed to FBI Public Affairs Specialist Sarah Ruane.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            On November 16, almost 3 weeks after the incident, the medical center announced that they are continuing to
            make steady progress in recovering systems from the cyberattack. “The University of Vermont Medical Center,
            Central Vermont Medical Center, Porter Medical Center and Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital now all have
            ‘read-only’ access to Epic, our electronic health records management system.” But they said they have no
            timeframe and were unsure whether a full restoration of systems would be possible.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            Since the ransomware on the medical center hit there had been a significant spike in Covid-19 in Vermont and
            the country.
            From October 28, the day
            of the cyberattack, to the day of this announcement, November 16, the 7-day daily average of new Coronavirus
            cases in Vermont <a target="_blank"
              href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/vermont-covid-cases.html">quadrupled</a> from 21 to 85
            cases. And new cases across the US went from a 75k daily average to
            a 155k daily average.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            Eight days later, access to the Epic electronic medical record system was fully restored. And on November
            27,
            two months following the ransomware attack, the medical center had restored the MyChart online patient
            portal
            which patients can log into via the website or MyChart mobile app. However, they also noted that “patients
            may
            see some temporary changes in the way they experience MyChart.”
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            According to Leffler, 600 of their applications were impacted by the cyberattack and as of December 8 2020,
            41 days after the cyberattack, over 70 applications were restored.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            Leffler says 6 weeks after the ransomware, "We really did not anticipate the scope or the impact the attack
            had
            on our system, and how far reaching it was. We had amazingly good strong plans for 3 days of downtime, 5
            days of
            downtime which is what we've experienced in the past. But 30 days of downtime across all systems was a true
            challenge for our staff."

          <p class="parag">
            The cyberattack had huge financial costs for the medical center, mostly in lost revenue.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            "All of our financial systems were down as well. We truly were on paper. Our CFO at the medical center,
            literally on the back of an envelope, thinks our revenue was down about 1.5 to 1.6 million dollars a
            day in services that we couldn't do. And we actually haven't calculated the cost of bringing the system up
            yet or all the cost of extra people here if there were patients because we just did what had to be done,"
            Leffler explained.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            But that wasn't it. Treatment of patients was hugely hindered.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            In the interim, clinicians were forced to send away hundreds of cancer patients, 
            said Olivia Thompson, a nurse at the cancer center, to NY Times.
          </p>
          <h3 class="section-head">Future</h3>
          <p class="parag">
            "We are bringing in new anti-virus software to our system and all computers.", Stephen Leffler says in a
            news conference,
            "The way our computers are all connected to each other, it meant that once the attack got into one of
            our computers at the medical center, it impacted five thousand of them. IT has told me that we are gonna
            disconnect
            them in a way that would make that much much harder to happen again. So if a virus did get into the system
            somehow, because there are bad people out there all the time trying to make that happen, it wouldn't be so
            widespread.
            The fact that at the medical center it was so widespread was really why the attack lasted so long and had
            such a great impact.
          </p>
          <p class="parag">
            Now, the medical center uses even more security precautions, improved security systems, and anti-virus
            software.
            But is it ever enough? How excessive must these precautions eventually go? And how do we know what’s
            necessary?

            The New York Times is a leading newspaper for information and stories in the US and around the world.
            It is known as a standard for professionally accurate and accountable resources. This article was first
            published 11 months ago
            and then updated a few weeks later. The information does not need to be any more recent because there hasn’t
            been further
            knowledge about the topic since the article’s publishing. The article directly supports my specific topic
            and
            explains many other concurrent events that connect to it such as cyberattacks on other American health
            systems,
            a specific Russian cybercriminal group, Trump firing the director of the cybersecurity agency responsible
            for defending critical
            systems. This article describes what was going on in the cancer center of the UVM Medical Center when they
            learned about the
            Cyberattack. It then connects the incident to a larger chain of cyberattacks that had been going on against
            health centers in the US,
            and a specific powerful cybercriminal group that had gotten away with it all. This source influenced my
            project because it describes
            a lot of concurrent events and gave me different possible directions I could go in for my story takeaway.
            This article was made to be
            unbiased because otherwise it would contain the header “[Opinion]” in the title, as NY Times makes sure to
            do with opinionated articles.

            VTDigger is a nonprofit online organization of Vermont journalism. They are qualified to write about the
            topic because it is a Vermont focused organization and the story happens in Vermont, and VTDigger does
            public-service journalism. This article was published just a few months ago, so it is very recent. The
            information directly explains objective facts about the event, and puts down the story of what happened
            before and after. It is largely direct quotes from people significant to the story such as Doug Gentile, the
            senior VP of network information technology at the UVM Medical Center. This article is factual and meant to
            be informative for the public. This article describes, largely in perspective of it’s IT Department, the UVM
            Medical Center as they found themselves victim of a cyberattack. It goes into how they responded by cutting
            off all network connections, finding the note left by the attackers, and going to the FBI. It describes the
            consequences including systems being down for several weeks and the problems with that, and how they were
            lucky that they didn’t lose confidential patient data. The article also explains the cause of the
            cyberattack of a single employee opening an email from a legitimate company that had been hacked. Finally,
            it describes all the precautions the medical center now takes including sending regular phishing emails,
            blocking access to personal email on work computers, and more anti-virus software. This article changed my
            thinking and influenced my project because it explained how the IT department had specifically been on the
            watch for this due to recent cyberattacks on other American health systems. But even still, one employee
            opening a single legitimate email was all it took, and they couldn’t do anything about it. It also makes me
            think about how even with all their excessive precautions, whether it would still be enough if they were
            targeted again.
