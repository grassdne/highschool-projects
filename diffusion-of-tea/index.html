           Chinese legend has tea as an accidental invention taking place in <b>2737 BCE</b>
           when tea leaves flew into mythical Emperor Shennong's boiled water.
           Hierarchical diffusion is responsible for the subsequent spread of the idea,
           or, at least, the believability of the legend.
           If just any person proclaimed their love for an infusion of some strange leaf,
           nobody would care. But an Emperor is a node of power whose beliefs and ideas can
           diffuse hierarchically ("History of Tea").

          In China during the Tang Dynasty (<b>618-906 CE</b>), tea leaves were shaped into dense bricks and used to make tea as a popular, refreshing beverage. 
          While earlier records show evidence of usage of the tea plant up to thousands of years earlier, it was primarily for medicinal purposes ("Cultural Selection").

          Tea was spread to Japan by Japanese monks who went to China to study Zen Buddhism in as early as the 8th century.
          At this time it was mainly consumed by aristocrats and priests.
          Tea drinking didn't become popular in Japan until the 12 century,
          but has since become a core cultural trait for Japanese people ("Steeped in History").

            "Today Japanese tea is seen as an inseparable part of Japanese culture," the Global Japanese Tea Association describes. <br>
            The Japanese Tea Ceremony is a precise cultural ritual for the preparation of Matcha
            green tea that has existed in Japanese culture for centuries. It's connected to
            Japanese art and religion.

            From China, tea and tea culture expanded contagiously along the Silk Roads.
            The tea trade spread to Japan, the Korean Peninsula, Tibet, and Mongolia.
            Tea was also linked to other Silk Roads trades like porcelain. "Today, cultures and regions around the world have continued to adapt the ubiquitous product according to their own societal norms, with brewing processes, flavouring, and social rituals varying from place to place" ("Cultural Selection").
            "kahwa" is a popular tea in the northern Indian Subcontinent often served at special occasions prepared in a samovar with cardamom, cinnamon, almonds and saffron. In what is today Afghanistan, ‘qymaq chai’ is pinkish in colour with added milk and cardamom ("Cultural Selection").
            This shows stimulus diffusion because the tea itself is the same concept to China or Britain,
            but has it's own method of brewing, spices, and other additions.

          Tea was shipped from China to Europe by the Netherlands and Portugal in the early
          17th century. According to the UK Tea and Infusions Association,
          princess Catherine Braganza was the beginning of tea drinking in Britain.
          She was Portuguese and a tea fanatic, and she married Charles II.
          Following the laws of hierarchical expansion diffusion, tea became popular in
          court and from there fashionable in the wealthy class.

          The British East India Company started tea plantations in Assam India instead of
          importing from China ("History of Tea"). This provoked a stimulus diffusion of tea within India.

        <div>
          European tea culture was quickly spread to the American colonies.
          The passion for tea was strong enough that it helped provoke incidents like the Boston Tea Party ("Steeped in History").
          Tea bags were invented in America in the early 1900's, as well as iced tea (Alexander).
